1. Landing Page
   Features:
   Primary Call to Action (CTA) Buttons: Prominently display buttons for "Login" and "Register". Ensure these buttons are visually distinct and easy to find.
   Visuals and Messaging: Use engaging graphics and concise text that clearly communicates the value of the app. This could be something like, "Organize Your Tasks Effortlessly".
   Responsive Design: The layout should adjust seamlessly between mobile and desktop views. On mobile, ensure that the CTA buttons are large enough to tap easily.
2. Navigation
   Desktop Navigation:
   Sidebar: Include a vertical sidebar with links to the Dashboard, Task Page, User Page, and any other important areas like Help or Support.
   Expand/Collapse Functionality: Consider making the sidebar collapsible to allow more screen space for the content.
   Mobile Navigation:
   Bottom Bar: Use a bottom navigation bar because itâ€™s within easy reach for thumb navigation. Include icons along with labels for clarity, such as Home, Tasks, User, etc.
   Consistency: Make sure the navigation elements remain consistent in terms of functionality across both mobile and desktop, though they may differ in layout and size.
3. Task Page
   List Filters:
   Dropdown Menu: Implement a dropdown menu to filter tasks by list. This menu should be easy to access and manipulate, even on mobile devices.
   Task Display:
   Compact View: Initially, show only the task title in a list view to keep the interface uncluttered.
   Expand on Tap: Tapping a task should expand it to show more details like description, due date, and status. This could be a modal, an accordion expansion, or a slide-in panel depending on what you find most intuitive on mobile.
   Action Buttons: Provide small icons or buttons for direct actions like edit, delete, or mark as complete right on the expanded task view.
