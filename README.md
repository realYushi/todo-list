## Overview

This repository contains the code for a comprehensive, full-stack ToDo List application. It's designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms. Users can register and log in with their unique username and password, allowing them to access their data from any device. The app offers robust user authentication, including the ability to update passwords.

Key features of the ToDo List app include:

-   List Management: Users can create, update, and organize lists, which serve as group units for tasks. Each list has a title and an optional description.
-   Task Creation: Within each list, users can create tasks with customizable titles and descriptions.
-   Due Date Functionality: Tasks can have optional due dates. When a due date passes, the task automatically enters an overdue status.
-   Flexible Task Management: Users can modify task titles, descriptions, and due dates, or remove due dates entirely.
-   Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard provides an overview of the user's productivity, displaying total task count, completed tasks, pending tasks, and overdue items.

This application showcases modern web development practices, incorporating React, .NET, SQL, and WebSockets. It's being developed using test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) methodologies, and is fully containerized using Docker.
